# download_artifact $file_name [$destination]
#
# $file_name should be the name of the file - it'll automatically be combined with the current build ID to differentiate between
# the same file in different jobs. It'll be identical to the `basename` of whatever you passed to `store_artifact`.
#
# $destination is an optional argument â€“ by default, `download_artifact` will download the artifact to the present working directory,
# but if you'd like it stored elsewhere, just pass the path as the second argument.
